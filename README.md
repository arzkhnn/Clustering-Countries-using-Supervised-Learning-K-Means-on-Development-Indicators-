# Clustering-Countries-using-Supervised-Learning-K-Means-on-Development-Indicators-
This project explores how nations can be grouped based on multiple dimensions of development rather than a single indicator like GDP. Using World Bank Development Indicators (2018â€“2020), the study applies data preprocessing, standardization, and K-Means clustering to segment 15 countries into meaningful groups.
